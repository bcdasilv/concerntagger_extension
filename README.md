# concerntagger_extension
We have implemented an extension of the ConcernTagger tool (Eclipse plugin) previously developed by Mark Eaddy.
You can find the original tool at: http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~eaddy/concerntagger/

Two main features implemented in this extension:
   * New metric view for LCbC (Lack of Concern-based Cohesion) metric.
   * LCbC computation.

This is an Eclipse plugin, so there are two ways of executing this project:
   * Importing the project as an eclipse plugin project and then run as eclipse plugin.
   * Install the plugin jar generated previously or download from the repository.
